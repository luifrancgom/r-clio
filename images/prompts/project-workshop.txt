One crate is labeled 'PROYECTO SILLA' and contains chair legs and a rolled blueprint; the other crate is closed and labeled 'PROYECTO CAMA'. The workbench surface is mostly clear, showing only a few essential tools like a chisel and a ruler neatly placed. Cinematic lighting, realistic wood textures, high detail, top-down perspective showing a professional and efficient workspace.",
